    "description": "The Virtual Crypto Coin (VCC) project aims to provide the art industry with tools to simplify the processes of buying and selling traditional artworks, paintings and sculptures, as well as digital ones, such as NFTs. The goal is to create partnerships with art galleries, allocating part of the profits to token liquidity in exchange for exclusive collections of NFTs. In this way, investors will have a steady increase in their portfolios outside the dynamics of the token market.",
